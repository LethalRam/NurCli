# 🔧 Step-by-Step Setup

## 2️⃣ Create the Database

# 🧯 Troubleshooting

If you're having database connection issues, check the following:

## 🔎 Database Type

- Make sure you are using **MariaDB or MySQL**
- ❌ Do NOT use SQLite

---

## 🔐 User Privileges

Ensure your database user:

- Has proper privileges
- Has correct host access:
  - `'username'@'127.0.0.1'`
  - `'username'@'localhost'`
  - Or `'username'@'%'` (⚠️ use `%` carefully)

---

## 🧾 Double Check Credentials

Verify:

- DB host
- DB username
- DB password
- DB name

All must match your actual database configuration.

---

## 📂 Wrapper Path

Make sure the bash wrapper contains the correct path to your `nur.php`.
